You can edit this R Markdown document, for example to explain what you're
doing and to draw conclusions from your data analysis. 

Auto-generated section titles, typically preceded by ###, can also be edited. 

It's generally not a good idea to edit the R code that the R Commander writes, 
but you can freely edit between (not within) R "code blocks." Each R code
block starts with ```{r} and ends with ```.
